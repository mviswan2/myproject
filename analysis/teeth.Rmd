## Introduction

Here we will analyze Tooth Growth data.

First let's read in the data.
```{r import-teeth}
teeth <- read.csv("data/teeth.csv", row.names = 1)
head(teeth)
```

Now let's look at some boxplots.
```{r boxplots}
boxplot(len ~ dose, data = teeth)
boxplot(len ~ supp, data = teeth)
boxplot(len ~ dose + supp, data = teeth)
```

Let's compare tooth length based on supplement type.
```{r permute}
# Observed difference in teeth length due to supplement method
mean(teeth$len[teeth$supp == "OJ"]) - mean(teeth$len[teeth$supp == "VC"])
# Permute the observations
supp_perm <- sample(teeth$supp)
# Calculate mean difference in permuted data
mean(teeth$len[supp_perm == "OJ"]) - mean(teeth$len[supp_perm == "VC"])
```
